# v0.1.0
- Optimized how multiline strings are parsed.
- Properties, attributes and selectors can now have dashes in the middle of them.
- Numbers can now have underscores in them (parity with luau).
- Tailwind colors defined with no shade will now default to shade `500` instead of `50`.
- Added functions for lexing and parsing utils (@util) - lex_rsml_utils & parse_rsml_utils.
- Added skin color presets - 4 undertones (rose, peach, gold and olive), and 11 shades (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950). They can be defined via the `skin:{undertone}:{shade}` syntax.
- Performing a mathemetical operation between 2 empty tuples will now result in `None` instead of `0`.
- Fixed issue with mathematical operations panicking due to overflows.
- Implemented statics ($!).
- Added `oklch` and `oklab` tuple annotations.
- All of the built in color presets (tw, css, bc, skin) have been changed to be in the oklab color space. The main noticeable change will be improved lerping.

- Fixed infinite recursion error when subtracting a non udim or udim2 from a number.
- Added macros.
